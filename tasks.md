# Ack Generator Refactoring Tasks

## Project Overview
This document tracks the progress of refactoring the `ack_generator` package from a monolithic structure to a clean, modular, and maintainable architecture. 

**Status: ✅ CORE REFACTORING COMPLETE**

We initially planned a 4-phase refactoring but made the pragmatic decision to stop after Phase 1 to avoid over-engineering. The core problems have been solved - the remaining tasks focus on cleanup and finalization rather than additional architectural changes.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### **🔧 Initial Analysis & Setup**
- [x] **Analyzed current codebase** and identified architectural issues
- [x] **Ran analyzer** and identified lint configuration warnings  
- [x] **Fixed analyzer warnings** by updating `analysis_options.yaml` files
- [x] **Created comprehensive feedback.md** with detailed refactoring plan
- [x] **Documented current state** and proposed improvements

### **📁 Phase 1: Extract Analysis Logic** *(COMPLETED)*
- [x] **Created directory structure:** `lib/src/analyzers/`
- [x] **Implemented TypeAnalyzer** 
  - Extracted type-related utilities (`getTypeName`, `getTypeString`, `isPrimitiveType`, etc.)
  - Added `getBaseSchemaType` for schema generation
  - Created `TypeName` class with proper equality/hashCode
- [x] **Implemented ConstraintAnalyzer**
  - Extracted constraint extraction logic from annotations
  - Support for all constraint types (IsEmail, MinLength, Max, etc.)
  - Created `PropertyConstraintInfo` hierarchy
- [x] **Implemented PropertyAnalyzer**  
  - Field and constructor parameter analysis
  - Required/nullable determination logic
  - Constraint application and dependency detection
- [x] **Implemented ClassAnalyzer**
  - Coordinate analysis of entire classes
  - Constructor discovery and parameter mapping
  - Dependency calculation and `ClassInfo` generation
- [x] **Refactored SchemaModelGenerator**
  - Updated to use new analyzer classes
  - Removed ~400 lines of duplicate code
  - Reduced from 800 lines to 400 lines
  - Fixed all compilation errors
- [x] **Updated exports and imports**
  - Cleaned up `ack_generator.dart` exports
  - Fixed test imports
  - Removed unused dependencies

### **🧪 Quality Assurance**
- [x] **Fixed all compilation errors** - Analyzer passes with 0 issues
- [x] **Updated test files** to use new analyzer imports
- [x] **Cleaned up unused imports** and variables
- [x] **Verified code structure** with proper separation of concerns

## ✅ Recently Completed Cleanup Tasks

### **🧹 Cleanup & Finalization** *(COMPLETED May 18, 2025)*
- [x] **Code Review & Cleanup**
  - ✅ Reviewed all refactored analyzer classes for consistency
  - ✅ Verified consistent naming conventions across all files
  - ✅ Confirmed no TODOs or debugging code remain
  - ✅ Verified all imports are necessary and properly organized
- [x] **Remove Redundant Code**
  - ✅ Confirmed no duplicate logic between analyzers
  - ✅ Verified no unused methods or classes exist
  - ✅ Cleaned up leftover comments from old implementation
  - ✅ Simplified generator logic where possible
- [x] **Critical Bug Fixes**
  - ✅ Fixed missing `validate()` method calls (now using `getSchema().validate()`)
  - ✅ Fixed abstract class instantiation issues
  - ✅ Fixed constructor parameter mismatches (positional vs named)
  - ✅ Fixed nullable property handling in `toMapFromModel` methods
  - ✅ Updated test files to use new constructor syntax
- [x] **Testing & Validation**
  - ✅ All existing tests now pass successfully
  - ✅ Tested with complex nested model examples (slide/block hierarchy)
  - ✅ Verified generated code quality matches requirements
  - ✅ Confirmed functionality is fully preserved
- [x] **Final Verification**
  - ✅ Dart analyzer passes with 0 issues on entire package
  - ✅ Package builds successfully with melos
  - ✅ All test examples work correctly
  - ✅ Backward compatibility confirmed

## 📋 Remaining Optional Tasks

### **📚 Optional Documentation Tasks**
- [ ] **Architecture Documentation** *(nice to have)*
  - Brief overview of the new analyzer-based architecture
  - Simple diagram showing component relationships
  - Migration notes for developers
- [ ] **Code Examples** *(nice to have)*
  - Document common patterns in the new architecture
  - Show how to extend with new constraint types
  - Examples of using the analyzer classes directly

### **📚 Optional Documentation Tasks**
- [ ] **Architecture Documentation** *(if time permits)*
  - Brief overview of the new analyzer-based architecture
  - Simple diagram showing component relationships
  - Migration notes for developers
- [ ] **Code Examples** *(if time permits)*
  - Document common patterns in the new architecture
  - Show how to extend with new constraint types
  - Examples of using the analyzer classes directly

### **🔄 Future Considerations** *(Parked for Later)*
- **Template System**: Only if string building becomes a real pain point
- **Plugin Architecture**: Only if extensibility is actually needed
- **Performance Optimization**: Only if performance issues are identified
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Only if current error handling proves insufficient

*Note: These are explicitly NOT being worked on now to avoid over-engineering*

## 📊 Progress Summary

| Phase | Status | Completion | Key Deliverables |
|-------|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Analysis & Setup** | ✅ Complete | 100% | Fixed analyzer, created plan |
| **Phase 1: Analysis** | ✅ Complete | 100% | Analyzer classes, refactored generator |
| **Cleanup & Finalization** | 🔄 In Progress | ~5% | Code review, testing, final polish |
| **~~Phase 2-5~~** | ❌ Skipped | N/A | *Avoided over-engineering* |

**Overall Core Refactoring: ✅ COMPLETE**
**Cleanup Tasks Remaining: ~10-15 items**

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Code Review**: Review all analyzer classes for consistency and cleanup
2. **Remove Redundancies**: Eliminate any remaining duplicate or unnecessary code
3. **Testing**: Ensure all functionality is preserved and add basic unit tests
4. **Final Validation**: Verify the refactored code works correctly end-to-end

## 📝 Notes

- **Pragmatic Decision**: Stopped at Phase 1 to avoid over-engineering
- **Major Goals Achieved**: Separated concerns, improved maintainability, reduced complexity
- **Current State**: 400 lines (down from 800), clean architecture, testable components
- **Philosophy**: "Good enough" is better than over-engineered complexity
